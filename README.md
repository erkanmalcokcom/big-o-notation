# big-o-notation

A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In computer science, it's used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. 

The Big O notation is not just a mathematical concept but a practical tool that gives you a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency. 

It's like a lens that helps you see how an algorithm's performance changes with the input data size. This understanding is crucial in determining the scalability of an algorithm or a piece of code. 

It's essential for comparing different algorithms' performance and understanding the trade-offs between different approaches, especially when dealing with large data sets.
